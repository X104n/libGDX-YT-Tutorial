# Reference project

This project was studied to see how the libGDX library is used in practice. We used this project as a reference for our own at the INF112 course at University of Bergen.

The project shows how to implement simple logic for a 2D platformer where the player (A box) is affected by gravity, and how to be effected by the enviorment. (Solid blocks and doubble jump)
